/**
 * Baseline opponent for the classic ruleset.
 *
 * Material scale: a chick is 100.
 *
 * - `lion: 0` is deliberate, not an oversight. Losing a lion is not a material
 *   loss in this ruleset — it ends the game, and the search scores that as a
 *   terminal win/loss which outranks any evaluation. Giving the lion a material
 *   value would only double-count an outcome the search already sees exactly.
 * - Giraffe slightly over elephant: orthogonal steps reach the far rank and the
 *   lion's escape squares more directly on a 3-wide board.
 * - Hen over both: it keeps a chick's forward push while gaining five directions.
 * - In-hand values sit ~10% above board values: a held piece can be dropped onto
 *   any empty square, so it is a flexible tempo/defence resource. This is the
 *   structural hook for spec item 8 (board vs hand valued separately).
 * - Positional weights are kept far below a chick on purpose. Material decides;
 *   mobility, control, lion safety and try progress only break near-ties.
 * - Per spec item 11 there is no flat "check bonus". Check shows up as lion
 *   exposure, and its real value (restricting the opponent) is what the search
 *   itself measures.
